    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two continuous variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The equation for simple linear regression is of the form y = a + bx, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b is the slope of the line, and a is the intercept. Simple linear regression can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we want to predict the weight of a person (dependent variable) based on their height (independent variable). We can use simple linear regression to create a model that relates height to weight. We collect data on the heights and weights of 100 people and fit a line to the data. The resulting equation might be: weight = 50 + 0.6*height. This equation tells us that for every one-unit increase in height, we expect a 0.6 unit increase in weight.\n",

    "Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between more than one independent variable and a dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is of the form y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn, where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, b1, b2, ..., bn are the slopes, and a is the intercept. Multiple linear regression can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given combination of values of the independent variables.\n",

    "Example: Suppose we want to predict the price of a house (dependent variable) based on its size, number of bedrooms, and location (independent variables). We can use multiple linear regression to create a model that relates these variables to house price. We collect data on the size, number of bedrooms, location, and price of 100 houses and fit a line to the data. The resulting equation might be: price = 100000 + 100size + 5000bedrooms + 10000*location. This equation tells us that for every one-unit increase in size, we expect a $100 increase in price, for every additional bedroom, we expect a $5000 increase in price, and for every location in a desirable area, we expect a $10000 increase in price.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept have specific interpretations that can help us understand the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. In other words, it tells us how much the dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes. A positive slope indicates a positive relationship between the variables, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.\n",

    "Suppose we want to investigate the relationship between the number of hours spent studying (independent variable) and the final exam grade (dependent variable) for a group of students. We collect data on 50 students and fit a linear regression model to the data. The resulting equation is:\n",

    "Final exam grade = 65 + 0.8 * Hours spent studying\n",

    "Interpretation of the intercept: The intercept is 65, which represents the expected final exam grade for a student who did not spend any time studying. However, this value may not be meaningful since it is unlikely that any student would receive a grade without studying at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of the slope: The slope is 0.8, which means that for every one hour increase in studying, we expect the final exam grade to increase by 0.8 points. This indicates a positive relationship between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam grade.\n",

    "Gradient descent is a powerful optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the optimal values of the model parameters that minimize the cost function. The cost function is a measure of the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the training dataset. The goal of gradient descent is to find the parameter values that minimize this cost function, which in turn makes the predictions more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively adjust the values of the model parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the cost function. The direction of steepest descent is given by the negative gradient of the cost function, which represents the direction of greatest decrease in the cost function. By following this direction, the algorithm tries to find the minimum value of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient descent algorithm works by taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to each of the model parameters. This gives us the direction and magnitude of the gradient, which we can use to update the parameter values. We start with an initial guess for the parameter values and update them using the gradient of the cost function until we reach a minimum.\n",

    "There are different variations of gradient descent, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent. In batch gradient descent, the entire training dataset is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration. In stochastic gradient descent, only one randomly selected training example is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration. In mini-batch gradient descent, a small batch of randomly selected training examples is used to calculate the gradient at each iteration.\n",

    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows us to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In multiple linear regression, the dependent variable is still assumed to be a linear function of the independent variables, but the equation is expanded to include all the independent variables.\n",

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, and we can estimate the slope and intercept using the method of least squares.
